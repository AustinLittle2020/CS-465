Architecture

    Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML,
    JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
    
        Express is a Node.js framework that allows for efficient development of Node based applications.
        The templating engine handlebars was also utilized to create templates and render HTML pages dynamically rather than
        the web pages being static. 
        
        Angular was utilized for the single-page application (SPA) and it is a frontend framework that is perfect for building
        SPAs. When the user first makes a HTTP request to the site, all of the responses needed to render the webpage and its 
        functionality is sent. This allows for users to access this page and the functionality of the page without necessarily
        having to be online. This framework also allows for the server to run more efficiently since it is not consistently
        putting out responses to the same user. The downsides that come along with a SPA is the difficulty in web-scrapers 
        succesfully scraping the page (which lowers search engine optimization (SEO)) and it also takes longer to first
        load the web-page (due to every aspect of the application being loaded at once). 
        
        JavaScript is a programming language which is widely used for front-end development. This language works perfectly
        in the MEAN stack and allow sfor the use of Node.js. Node.js is used as a back-end JavaScript engine and executes 
        JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 
    
    Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
    
        The backend utilizes a NoSQL MongoDB database due to the speed and structure that it provides. MongoDB also works 
        hand-in-hand with JSON and JavaScript. This made it a prime choice for the database in this application. 

Functionality

    How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
    Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and 
    name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
    
        JavaScript is a programming language, while JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data transmission format.
        HTTP requests contain JSON data which is how API requests can get a proper response that is understood by
        the compiler. JSON is utilized for front-end use when a user makes an HTTP request, and also in the back-end
        when the request is read and a response is sent. 
        
        Reusable user interface components are important to reduce the complexity of code and the chance for errors.
        This also allows for more efficient development of projects and keeps the design for UX/UI designers more
        simplistic and ensures the proper application development best practices can be asily followed. 

Testing

    Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties
    of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack 
    application.

Reflection

    How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered
    in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

        CS-465 has helped me in reaching my professional goals by teaching me the skills necessary to build a full-stack
        web application. Being pushed and mentored through developing a web application utilizing the MEAN stack with 
        client/server development, security, SPAs and REST APIs made me more of an asset to the tech industry and allowed for
        me to feel more confident as a developer.
